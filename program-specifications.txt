    -- objectives -- 
  - device initialization
      - turn off watchdog timer
      - oscillator
          - turn off external oscillator in external oscillator control 
            register (OSCXCN)
          - use internal oscillator at 16MHz in internal oscillator control 
            register (OSCICN)
      - port
          - enable UART0 in cross-bar to route UART TX and RX to pins (P0.0 - 
            Tx, P0.1 - Rx)
          - enable cross-bar (XBARE) for output and weak pull-ups
          - port 0 
            configure P0.0 (Tx) as push-pull (output) & P0.1 (Rx) as 
            open-drain (input)
      - timer 2 
          - timer 2 uses SYSCLK as timebase (T2M=1 in CKCON) 
          - timer 2 in mode 2 (baud generator mode); RCLK=TCLK=1 
          - RCAP2L/H loaded with appropriate values for 9600 bps baud rate
            (calculated) 
      - UART 
          - UART in mode 1 (SM0-1=01 in SCON); 8-bit UART variable baud rate 
          - UART reception enabled (REN=1 in SCON) 

  - UART interrupt 
      - RI (in SCON) is checked if set; then RI is reset and the received byte 
        is handled 
      - TI (in SCON) is checked if set; then TI is reset and the transmit byte 
        is handled

    -- objectives -- 
  - device initialization
      - turn off watchdog timer
      - oscillator
          - turn off external oscillator in external oscillator control 
            register (OSCXCN)
          - use internal oscillator at 16MHz in internal oscillator control 
            register (OSCICN)
      - port
          - enable cross-bar (XBARE) for output and weak pull-ups
          - port 0 
            configure P0.0-7 as push-pull and intialize outputs to low.
          - port 1
            configure P1.0-3 as push-pull and leave P1.4-7 as open-drain. keep
            P1.0-3 outputs in its default high, make sure P1.4-7 are in input 
            mode (high). 

  - keypad 
    - write readkeypad routine to read in the number pressed on the keypad 
      matrix. 
    - row_1-4 (R1-4) are configured as push-pull outputs (P1.0-3), and col_1-3
      (C1-3) are configured as open-drain inputs (P1.4-6).

  - 7-segment display
    - write displaynumber routine to display number the pressed number on the 
      keypad. this will use port 0 (P0.0-6) to toggle LEDs (direct driven).
  
  - main keypad routine
    the main will initialization the device then enter infinite loop to 
    read keypad input and display on 7-seg.
